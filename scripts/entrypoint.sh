# a one-time restore. Every write made between deploys used to live only on
# this container's ephemeral disk and vanish the moment Cloud Run recycled
# the instance (min-instances=0 makes that routine, not rare). litestream
# replicate -exec runs the app as its child process and streams the SQLite
# WAL to GCS as it's written, so a restart picks up from litestream's own
# replica rather than losing everything since the last manual snapshot.
